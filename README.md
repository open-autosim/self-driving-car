# Self-Driving Car Simulation

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a self-driving car simulation, part of the Open AutoSim project. It's designed to provide a realistic environment for testing and developing autonomous vehicle algorithms.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- C++ Compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- Make
- Any additional libraries or tools specified in the project

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/open-autosim/self-driving-car.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd self-driving-car


## Building the Project
1. Compile the code using Make:
make

This will generate the executable needed to run the simulation.

## Running the Simulation
1. To start the simulation, run the generated executable:
./[executable-name]

Replace `[executable-name]` with the actual name of the generated file.

## Usage
- Details about how to use the simulation, including any command-line arguments, configuration options, or interactive controls.

## Contributing
- Guidelines for contributing to the project, including coding standards, pull request process, etc.

## License
